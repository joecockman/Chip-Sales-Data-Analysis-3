# Quantium-Virtual-Internship-Chip-Sales-Data-Analysis-3

Part 3 of the Quantium virtual internship. The task was to prepare a final report to present to the head of the Chip Sales Retail Team, detailing my analysis and providing recommendations.

The final powerpoint can be found in the file repository.

The high level findings from the report were as follows.

 - Older age groups were critical in the last year, accounting for over 50% of all sales.

 - Larger sharing bags were by far the most popular choice as consumers look to for volume and value for money as a priority.

 - Mainstream and budget customers comfortably outperformed premium customers.

 - The 3 trial stores all saw improvements during the trial period, though 2/3 were outperformed by their respective control stores. Because of this, it is not clear whether the trial has had a significant impact.

Overall the virtual internship has been a challenging yet wonderfully informative experience and has allowed realistic hands-on practice of all the skills I have spent the last year working on.
